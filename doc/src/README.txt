The 'doc/src/' directory is a shadow directory for the main '/src'
directory. The files in it contain documentation on how to use the files
in the main directory. This document gives a brief overview of the HTML
and CSS files. See EECS448_Calendar/angular-docs for front-end 
documentation.

NOTE: CSS documentation does not cover basic styling/structure, only
unique cases that are not immediately obvious.
