The 'doc/backEnd/' directory is a shadow directory for the main '/backEnd'
directory. The files in it contain documentation on how to use the files
in the main directory. This document gives a brief overview.

backEnd/cgi-bin/Calendar.cgi
	The main script.
	Waits for an http PUT request that contains a JSON command and arguments.
	Parses the command and calls the appropriate function with the arguments.
	Does this to display and manipulate data from a database the represents a
	year school calendar.
	This script needs to go in the directory that will allow
	URLs to make rest calls to it.
	The line: use lib "/home/jfustos/EECS448/Calendar";
		needs to be changed to point to the directory where everything else
		will be installed.

backEnd/modules
	The modules that the main script calls into. Most of the heavy lifting
	is done within these. Described in doc/backEnd/modules.

backEnd/db.txt
backEnd/db.txt.bak
	Currently the database is implemented as a text file that has a JSON
	structure held within it. This file will need to initially be copied
	over so the base structure of the data is there.
	The .bak version of the file is the same just with a known good version
	of the data incase it gets corrupted.
	The location of this file can be modified from: 
		backEnd/modules/Conf.pm => $conf{'dbFile'}

backEnd/log.txt
	The log file for the backend. While some information is sent back over
	the http response, more in-depth information is stored here.
	This file does not need to be copied over, it will be created if it
	is missing. This file is just here for reference.
	Its location may be changed by editing:
		backEnd/modules/Conf.pm => $conf{'logFile'}

backEnd/tests/EECS448_test_back_end.html
	This html file is used to test the rest services provided by Calendar.cgi.
	You will need to copy it to a location where it can be accessed and
	then change the internal url to point to Calendar.cgi.
	The individual buttons test the individual commands provided.
